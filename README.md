## Features
- [x] <b>User registration</b> <br>
In order to create an account, users must provide his/her first name and last name, a phone number, an FIU email, and a password between 8-32 characters in length with at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character.
- [x] <b>Password encryption</b> <br>
Passwords are hashed multiple rounds using bcrypt and managed using best practices.
- [x] <b>User login</b> <br>
In order to login, users are asked to provide the FIU email and password he/she used to register. In the future, users will be able to login using their phone number as well.
- [x] <b>Search for a course by code</b> <br>
Currently, users are able to search for a course by code (i.e. COP3530). Additional functionality, search by reference and/or search by test (i.e. GRE), will be implemented in the future.
- [x] <b>Custom domain</b> <br>
Since .com was taken, it only made sense to buy .coffee.
- [x] <b>JWT authentication</b>
      <br>
      Authentication and authorization of the application are handled by jsonwebtoken. Due to some limitations from the current implementation, auth0 and passport are being looked into for refreshing tokens, as well as registering/logging in since FIU uses Google mail.
- [x] <b>Verify email address</b>
      <br>
- [ ] <b>Verify phone number</b>
      <br>
- [ ] <b>Include Account Kit by Facebook as registration option </b> <br>
- [x] <b>Filter results (professor, reference number) </b> <br>
- [ ] <b>Sort results</b> <br>
